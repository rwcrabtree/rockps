This is for the rock paper scissors project in Odin. This is the first project since starting JavaScript. I see it being a lot of if/else statements and variable declaration. I will set up counters to determine the number of wins each player has and a loop to replay the game until a player completes best of 5, terminating early if a player wins 3, as the opponent woun't be able to win at that point.
This edit is just to follow the directions in "Git Basics" in the Odin Project for me to learn git.
